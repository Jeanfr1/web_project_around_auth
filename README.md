Project: Registration and Authorization Front-End

This project is a front-end implementation for user registration and authorization, designed to be part of a web application. The focus of this project was on creating a user-friendly interface and secure handling of user data during the registration and login processes. Below is a detailed breakdown of the technologies used and the structure of the project.

Technologies Used:

React.js,React Router,Context API,useState, useEffect, useRef Hooks,Form Validation,API Integration, Image Assets, CSS

How It Works

Registration: Users can register by filling out the form on the signup page. Upon successful registration, a modal displays a success message, and the user is redirected to the login page.
Login: Registered users can log in using their email and password. Successful login stores the JWT token in local storage and grants access to protected routes.
Protected Routes: Once logged in, users can access protected areas of the application, with their session maintained using the JWT token.
User Context: The application uses Context API to manage and access the logged-in user's data across different components, ensuring that the UI updates dynamically based on the user's state.

Conclusion:

This project showcases the implementation of a registration and authorization system using modern front-end technologies. By leveraging React's component-based architecture, Context API, and hooks, the project ensures a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly application.
